        "content": "For a while now, we’ve craved a great Manoj Bajpayee performance in theatres. Sonchiriya was a lifetime ago, Suraj Pe Mangal Bhari droll but undistinguished. Instead, all his recent feats have been on the web; season two of The Family Man, Rayand Gulmohar. He has found a new home on OTT (and a dedicated audience base). The exhibition arena is still wobbly, so it makes sense for Sirf Ek Bandaa Kaafi Hai — a debut feature by Apoorv Singh Karki — to arrive directly on ZEE5. Nevertheless, I wish the film had secured a theatrical release. A courtroom drama of the old school, it features a blazing, live wire Bajpayee; not the sort of performance to be savoured on laptops and phones. andaa begins with multiple disclaimers, including one that says, “The film is a dramatisation of events.” By the time a devastated young girl has recorded her statement in Delhi and a bearded saint with a beatific smile is picked up in Jodhpur, we know what events are being traced. In 2013, self-styled godman Asaram Bapu was arrested for raping a 16-year-old minor in one of his ashrams. After five years, he was held guilty and imprisoned for life. It was a landmark case under The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act; PC Solanki, a small-time Jodhpur lawyer who went toe-to-toe with formidable legal bigwigs, became its heroic face. In the film, Asaram isn’t referred to by name (the character, played with creepy equanimity by Surya Mohan Kulshreshtha, is simply addressed as ‘Baba’). PC Solanki, however, is PC Solanki. Early on, he’s approached by the victim’s parents to fight their case. Their previous lawyer was outed negotiating a bribe with Baba’s cohorts, a tactic that will recur throughout the film, along with witness intimidation, vitriolage, and open murder outside court. “There will be many dangers, difficulties,” Solanki (Manoj) forewarns his clients and himself. He’s fully aware of the implications of going against a dangerous and influential cult; he has a young son and an aging mother at home.  "
